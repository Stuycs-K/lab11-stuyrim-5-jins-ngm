## Adventurer Subclasses

# **Barista**
- special: rating
- attack: make a really bad drink that makes the enemy throw up, decreasing their HP
- support: make a really delicious drink, increasing own HP and special
- special attack: throwing drinks, taking away own HP for more damage
- passive ability: if HP is below 50%, damage of any attack (both normal and special attack) is increased by 20%
# **PastryChef**
- special: sugar
- attack: make a pastry with raw eggs so that the opponent gets salmonella. They will then lose HP at every subsequent turn until they are healed by either a teammate or themself.
- support: make a really good cake that cheers up a chosen party member (including themself), increasing their HP and special
- special attack: if they have enough sugar, they can use their normal attack on multiple opponents 
- passive ability: when sugar is below 30%, their pastry also will also taste really bad, so the opponent loses some HP upon eating it in addition to contracting salmonella
# **PrepChef**
- special: money
- attack: steals ingredients from their opponent, decreasing their special attribute
- support: they went outside, bought ingredients and prepped them, increasing HP and special of everyone in their party and increasing their damage for the next move
- special: they buy everyone on their team aprons, casting a shield (which has shieldHP based on money consumed)
- passive ability: when casting the shield, there is a 50% chance the aprons are extra fancy and deal rebound damage when hit by an opponent
